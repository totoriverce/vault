```release-note:bug
ui: Resolved accessibility issues with Web REPL. Associated label and help text with input, added a conditional to show the console/ui-panel only when toggled open, added keyboard focus trap. Note: this required an additional arg added for testing, to toggle the console open when it is necessary to use the console in tests.
