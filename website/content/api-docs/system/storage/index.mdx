  The '/sys/storage' endpoints are used to manage Vault's storage backends.

This API sub-section is currently only used to manage [Raft](/api-docs/system/storage/raft) storage backend.

On Enterprise there are additional endpoints for working with [Raft Automated Snapshots](/api-docs/system/storage/raftautosnapshots).
