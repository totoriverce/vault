# `/sys/generate-recovery-token`

The `/sys/generate-recovery-token` endpoint is used to create a new recovery
token for Vault.

## Read Recovery Token Generation Progress

This endpoint reads the configuration and process of the current root generation
attempt.

| Method | Path                                   |
| :----- | :------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/sys/generate-recovery-token/attempt` |

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/generate-recovery-token/attempt
```

### Sample Response

```json
{
  "started": true,
  "nonce": "2dbd10f1-8528-6246-09e7-82b25b8aba63",
  "progress": 1,
  "required": 3,
  "encoded_token": "",
  "pgp_fingerprint": "",
  "otp_length": 24,
  "complete": false
}
```

If a recovery token generation is started, `progress` is how many unseal keys
have been provided for this generation attempt, where `required` must be reached
to complete. The `nonce` for the current attempt and whether the attempt is
complete is also displayed.

If a PGP key is being used to encrypt the final root
token, its fingerprint will be returned.

If an OTP is being used to encode the final root token it will be returned only
once, on the response to the start request.

The OTP is a base62 string, with length of otp_length.
The raw bytes (char codes) of the token will be XOR'd with
this value before being returned as a response to the final unseal
key, encoded as base64.

## Start Recovery Token Generation

This endpoint initializes a new recovery token generation attempt. Only a single
recovery token generation attempt can take place at a time.

| Method | Path                                   |
| :----- | :------------------------------------- |
| `PUT`  | `/sys/generate-recovery-token/attempt` |

### Parameters

- `pgp_key` `(string: <optional>)` – Specifies a base64-encoded PGP public key.
  The raw bytes of the token will be encrypted with this value before being
  returned to the final unseal key provider.

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --request PUT \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/generate-recovery-token/attempt
```

### Sample Response

```json
{
  "started": true,
  "nonce": "2dbd10f1-8528-6246-09e7-82b25b8aba63",
  "progress": 1,
  "required": 3,
  "encoded_token": "",
  "otp": "2vPFYG8gUSW9npwzyvxXMug0",
  "otp_length": 24,
  "complete": false
}
```

## Cancel Recovery Token Generation

This endpoint cancels any in-progress recovery token generation attempt. This
clears any progress made. This must be called to change the OTP or PGP key being
used.

| Method   | Path                                   |
| :------- | :------------------------------------- |
| `DELETE` | `/sys/generate-recovery-token/attempt` |

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --request DELETE \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/generate-recovery-token/attempt
```

## Provide Key Share to Generate Recovery Token

This endpoint is used to enter a single master key share to progress the
recovery token generation attempt. If the threshold number of master key shares
is reached, Vault will complete the recovery token generation and issue the new
token. Otherwise, this API must be called multiple times until that threshold
is met. The attempt nonce must be provided with each call.

Note that once a token has been issued, Vault is unsealed. The token lives
only in memory and thus will only be valid until the next restart.

| Method | Path                                  |
| :----- | :------------------------------------ |
| `PUT`  | `/sys/generate-recovery-token/update` |

### Parameters

- `key` `(string: <required>)` – Specifies a single master key share.

- `nonce` `(string: <required>)` – Specifies the nonce of the attempt.

### Sample Payload

```json
{
  "key": "acbd1234",
  "nonce": "ad235"
}
```

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --request PUT \
    --data @payload.json \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/generate-recovery-token/update
```

### Sample Response

This returns a JSON-encoded object indicating the attempt nonce, and completion
status, and the encoded recovery token, if the attempt is complete.

```json
{
  "started": true,
  "nonce": "2dbd10f1-8528-6246-09e7-82b25b8aba63",
  "progress": 3,
  "required": 3,
  "pgp_fingerprint": "",
  "complete": true,
  "encoded_token": "FPzkNBvwNDeFh4SmGA8c+w=="
}
```
