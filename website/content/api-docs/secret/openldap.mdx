# OpenLDAP Secrets Engine (API)

This is the API documentation for the Vault OpenLDAP secrets engine. For general
information about the usage and operation of the OpenLDAP secrets engine,
please see [these docs](/docs/secrets/openldap).

This documentation assumes the OpenLDAP secrets engine is enabled at the `/openldap` path
in Vault. Since it is possible to mount secrets engines at any path, please
update your API calls accordingly.

## Configuration Management

| Method   | Path               |
| :------- | :----------------- |
| `POST`   | `/openldap/config` |
| `GET`    | `/openldap/config` |
| `DELETE` | `/openldap/config` |

This endpoint configures the OpenLDAP secret engine to managed user entries.

Note: the OpenLDAP entry used by `config` should have the necessary privileges
to search and change entry passwords in OpenLDAP.

### Parameters

- `binddn` `(string: <required>)` - Distinguished name (DN) of object to bind for managing user entries.<br />
  **Example:** `cn=vault,ou=Users,dc=hashicorp,dc=com`
- `bindpass` `(string: <required>)` - Password to use along with `binddn` for managing user entries.
- `url` `(string: "ldap://127.0.0.1")` - The LDAP server to connect to. Examples: `ldaps://ldap.myorg.com`,
  `ldaps://ldap.myorg.com:636`. This can also be a comma-delineated list of URLs, e.g.
  `ldaps://ldap.myorg.com, ldaps://ldap.myorg.com:636`, in which case the servers will be tried in-order if
  there are errors during the connection process.`.
- `password_policy` `(string: <optional>)` - The name of the [password policy](/docs/concepts/password-policies)
  to use to generate passwords. Note that this accepts the name of the policy, not the policy itself.
- `schema` `(string: "openldap")` - The OpenLDAP schema to use when storing entry passwords.
  Valid schemas include:`openldap`, `racf` and `ad`.
- `request_timeout` `(integer: 90, string: "90s" <optional>)` - Timeout, in seconds, for the connection when
  making requests against the server before returning back an error.
- `starttls` `(bool: <optional>)` - If true, issues a `StartTLS` command after establishing an unencrypted connection.
- `insecure_tls` - `(bool: <optional>)` - If true, skips LDAP server SSL certificate verification - insecure,
  use with caution!
- `certificate` - `(string: <optional>)` - CA certificate to use when verifying LDAP server certificate, must be
  x509 PEM encoded.
- `client_tls_cert` - `(string: <optional>)` - Client certificate to provide to the LDAP server, must be x509
  PEM encoded.
- `client_tls_key` - `(string: <optional>)` - Client key to provide to the LDAP server, must be x509 PEM encoded.

**Deprecated Parameters**:

- `length` `(int: 64)` - The length of generated password strings. Note: some schemas may require shorter
  password lengths (such as `racf`). Mutually exclusive with `password_policy`

**Note about password generation**:

`length` and `password_policy` cannot both be set in the configuration. The `POST` endpoint will reject the
configuration if both are specified.

- If neither are set, this will default to a reasonable default password generation algorithm (the same algorithm as
  prior to the introduction of password policies).
- If `length` is set, the same algorithm is used, but with the length specified instead of the default length.
- If `password_policy` is set, the password will be generated from the associated
  [password policy](/docs/concepts/password-policies). The policy is not exercised prior to saving the configuration.
  The policy will need to exist prior to passwords needing to be generated by this engine, but does not need to exist
  prior to saving the configuration.

See [OpenLDAP docs](/docs/secrets/openldap) for additional information.

## Dynamic Roles

Create or update a dynamic role configuration. This provides instructions to Vault on how to create an
OpenLDAP domain user account.

### Create/Delete Dynamic Role Configuration

#### Parameters

| Method   | Path                        |
| :------- | :-------------------------- |
| `POST`   | `/openldap/role/:role_name` |
| `DELETE` | `/openldap/role/:role_name` |

The `POST` endpoint allows for partial updates of existing roles. If a role exists and a `POST` request is made
against it, only the keys specified in the request will be updated. To delete a value, specify the key with an
empty string as the value. Example: `vault write openldap/role/myrole default_ttl=""`

`role_name` `(string, required)` - The name of the dynamic role.

`creation_ldif` `(string, required)` - A templatized LDIF string used to create a user account. This may contain
multiple LDIF entries. The `creation_ldif` can also be used to add the user account to an **_existing_** group.
All LDIF entries are performed in order. If Vault encounters an error while executing the `creation_ldif` it will
stop at the first error and not execute any remaining LDIF entries. If an error occurs and `rollback_ldif` is
specified, the LDIF entries in `rollback_ldif` will be executed. See `rollback_ldif` for more details. This field
may optionally be provided as a base64 encoded string.

`deletion_ldif` `(string, required)` - A templatized LDIF string used to delete the user account once its TTL has
expired. This may contain multiple LDIF entries. All LDIF entries are performed in order. If Vault encounters an
error while executing an entry in the `deletion_ldif` it will attempt to continue executing any remaining entries.
This field may optionally be provided as a base64 encoded string.

`rollback_ldif` `(string, not required but recommended)` - A templatized LDIF string used to attempt to rollback
any changes in the event that execution of the `creation_ldif` results in an error. This may contain multiple LDIF
entries. All LDIF entries are performed in order. If Vault encounters an error while executing an entry in the
`rollback_ldif` it will attempt to continue executing any remaining entries. This field may optionally be provided
as a base64 encoded string.

`username_template` `(string)` - A template used to generate a dynamic username. This will be used to fill in the
`.Username` field within the `creation_ldif` string.

`default_ttl` `(string/int)` - Specifies the TTL for the leases associated with this role. Accepts time suffixed
strings ("1h") or an integer number of seconds. Defaults to system/engine default TTL time. The
[available units](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) are: `ns`, `us` (or `Âµs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`.

`max_ttl` `(string/int)` - Specifies the maximum TTL for the leases associated with this role. Accepts time suffixed
strings ("1h") or an integer number of seconds. Defaults to system/mount default TTL time; this value is allowed to
be less than the mount max TTL (or, if not set, the system max TTL), but it is not allowed to be longer. The
[available units](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) are: `ns`, `us` (or `Âµs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`.

The `creation_ldif`, `deletion_ldif`, `rollback_ldif`, and `username_template` fields are all templated fields. See
[Username Templating](/docs/concepts/username-templating) for details on how to use templating. Also see
[Templates](#templates) for specifics on what data is available for each template.

#### Sample Payload

Sample LDIF files:

`creation.ldif`:

```
dn: cn={{.Username}},ou=users,dc=learn,dc=example
objectClass: person
objectClass: top
cn: learn
sn: {{.Password | utf16le | base64}}
memberOf: cn=dev,ou=groups,dc=learn,dc=example
userPassword: {{.Password}}
```

`deletion.ldif` & `rollback.ldif`:

```
dn: cn={{.Username}},ou=users,dc=learn,dc=example
changetype: delete
```

  "deletion_ldif": "...",
  "rollback_ldif": "...",
  "username_template": "...",
  "default_ttl": "1h",
  "max_ttl": "24h"
}
```

-> Note: The LDIF statements may optionally be base64 encoded. If they are base64 encoded when creating/updating the
role configuration, the decoded version will be returned from the `GET` endpoint.

    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request POST \
    --data @payload.json \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/openldap/role/dynamic-role
```

### Read Dynamic Role Configuration

| Method | Path                        |
| ------ | --------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/openldap/role/:role_name` |

Retrieves a dynamic role's configuration.

#### Parameters

None

#### Response

`200 OK`

```json
{
  "creation_ldif": "...",
  "default_ttl": 1800,
  "deletion_ldif": "...",
  "max_ttl": 0,
  "rollback_ldif": "...",
  "username_template": "..."
}
```

### Templates

LDIF and username templates use the [Go template syntax](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) to construct the
LDIF/username that will be executed against the server. This is done because certain values (such as the username
and password within an LDIF statement) are not known at configuration time. Additionally, the template gives a
lot of flexibility to the operator to construct the LDIF and username.

Templated fields are delimited by `{{` and `}}`. To reference a field (such as the generated `Username`), a period is
placed in front of the field name. Example: `{{.Username}}`. Spaces can be included between `{{` and `}}`. For instance:
`{{.Username|lowercase}}` is the same as `{{ .Username | lowercase }}`.

If a field needs to be modified (such as SHA256 hashing, base64 encoding, etc.) the value can be sent to one of the
[built-in functions](#template-functions). This uses a "pipe" syntax: `{{.Username | base64}}`. Values may be "piped"
to multiple functions: `{{.Username | lowercase | base64}}`

#### LDIF Template Fields

The following parameters are available within the LDIF templates:

`.Username` - The name of the generated user (optionally from `username_template`).<br />
**Default pattern:** `v_<display name>_<role name>_<10 random chars>_<unix timestamp>`

`.Password` - The generated password (optionally from
[password policies](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/password-policies))

`.RoleName` - The name of the role that credentials are being generated for.

`.DisplayName` - The display name associated with the authentication token used to make the credentials request.

`.IssueTime` - The time that the lease was created. This time may be slightly earlier than the associated lease due to
where this value is calculated compared with where Vault calculates details of the lease.<br />
**Format:** 2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00 ([RFC3339](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#pkg-constants))

`.IssueTimeSeconds` - The [unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) the lease was created. This time may
be slightly earlier than the associated lease due to where this value is calculated compared with where Vault
calculates details of the lease.<br />
**Format:** Integer indicating the number of seconds elapsed since January 1, 1970.

`.ExpirationTime` - The time that the lease is set to expire. This time may be slightly earlier than the associated
lease due to where this value is calculated compared with where Vault calculates details of the lease.<br />
**Format:** 2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00 ([RFC3339](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#pkg-constants))

`.ExpirationTimeSeconds` - The [unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) the lease is set to expire. This
time may be slightly earlier than the associated lease due to where this value is calculated compared with where Vault
calculates details of the lease.<br />
**Format:** Integer indicating the number of seconds elapsed since January 1, 1970.

#### Username Template Fields

The following parameters are available within the username template:

**Important note:** If any of the following fields include dashes or underscores, they will not be removed/changed
unless explicitly done so within the username template. For instance:

If `RoleName` is `test-role` and the `username_template` is `v_{{.RoleName}}_{{unix_time}}`, the result of this template
may be: `v_test-role_1234567890`. Note the `-` (dash) in the `test-role`. If the LDAP system Vault is managing
restricts usernames/DNs to not allow for dashes (or other characters), the template must explicitly modify/remove those
characters. In this example, the template can be changed to `v_{{.RoleName | replace "-" "_"}}` to replace
the dashes with underscores. See [Template Functions](#template-functions) for more functions available.

`.RoleName` - The name of the role the credentials are being generated from.

`.DisplayName` - The display name associated with the user making the request against Value.

#### Template Functions

Both the LDIF templates and the username template use the [Go template language](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template)
so all [functions](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#hdr-Functions) and capabilities from that language are
supported including functions such as `printf`.

In addition to the functions available through the template language, the following custom functions are also available:

`random` - Generates a random string from lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numbers. Must include a
number indicating how many characters to generate.<br />
**Example:** `{{random 20}}` generates 20 random characters

`truncate` - truncates the previous value to the provided number of characters.<br />
**Example:** `{{.FieldName | truncate 10}}`

`truncate_sha256` - Truncates the previous value to the provided number of characters. The last 8 characters of the
truncated value will be the first 8 characters of the SHA256 hash of the truncated characters.

This can aid in identifying values (such as the role & display names) if they need to be truncated to a particular
length, particularly if the value has common prefixes. An example of this is having many roles with a common prefix in
the name of the role, but the role name is truncated such that only the prefix is shown. This function will keep the
non-prefix part of the role name in the username which will aid in identification while also keeping uniqueness.

**Example:**<br />
`v_{{.RoleName | truncate_sha256 15}}_{{unix_time}}`. <br />
If two roles exist for this template, `myreallylongprefix-foobar` and `myreallylongprefix-bazqux`, the username for the first role
would be `v_myrealle6da86ec_1234567890` and the username for the second role would be `v_myrealld0420a55_1234567890`.

`uppercase` - Uppercases the provided value.<br />
**Example:** `{{.FieldName | uppercase}}`

`lowercase` - Lowercases the provided value.<br />
**Example:** `{{.FieldName | lowercase}}`

`replace` - Find/replace on the provided value.<br />
**Example:** `{{.FieldName | replace "-" "_"}}`

`sha256` - SHA256 hashes the provided value.<br />
**Example:** `{{.FieldName | sha256}}`

`base64` - Base64 encodes the provided value.<br />
**Example:** `{{.FieldName | base64}}`

`unix_time` - The current unix timestamp (number of seconds since Jan 1 1970).<br />
**Example:** `{{unix_time}}`

`unix_time_millis` - The current unix timestamp in milliseconds.<br />
**Example:** `{{unix_time_millis}}`

`timestamp` - The current time. Must provide a formatting string based on Goâs time package.<br />
**Example:** `{{timestamp "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z"}}`

`uuid` - Generates a random UUID.<br />
**Example:** `{{uuid}}`

##### LDIF Template Functions

Additionally, the LDIF templates include an additional function to facilitate Active Directory password handling.
The username template cannot use this function.

`utf16le` - Encodes the provided value into UTF16-LE.<br />
**Example:** `{{.FieldName | utf16le}}`
