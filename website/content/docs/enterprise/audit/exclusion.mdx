# Exclusion syntax for audit results

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

As of Vault 1.18.0, you can enable audit devices with an `exclude` option to exclude
particular fields in an audit entry, written to a particular audit log and fine-tune
your auditing process.

<Warning title="Proceed with caution">

  Excluding audit entry fields is an advanced feature. Use of exclusion settings
  could lead to missing data in your audit logs.

  **Always** test your audit configuration in a non-production environment
  before deploying exclusions to production. And make sure to read the
  [Vault security model](/vault/docs/internals/security) and
  [filtering overview](/vault/docs/concepts/filtering) to familiarize yourself
  with Vault auditing and filtering basics before enabling audit devices which use
  exclusions.

</Warning>

Once you enable an audit device with exclusions, every audit entry Vault sends to
that audit device is compared to an (optional) predicate expression (condition).
Before being written to the audit log for the device, audit entries that match the
expression are then modified to remove the fields specified for that condition.
It is possible to specify multiple sets of condition and field combinations for an
individual audit device.

When you enable audit devices that use exclusion, the behavior of any existing audit
device and the behavior of new audit devices that **do not** use exclusion remains
unchanged.

## `exclude` option

The value provided with the `exclude` option must be a parsable JSON array (i.e. JSON or
an escaped JSON string) of exclusion objects.

### Exclusion object

- `condition` `(string: <optional>)` - predicate expression using [filtering syntax](/vault/docs/concepts/filtering),
when matched Vault will attempt to remove values identified by `fields`.
- `fields` `(string[] <required>)` - collection of fields in the audit entry to exclude,
identified using [JSON pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) syntax.

```json
[
  {
    "condition": "",
    "fields": [ "" ]
  }
]
```

Each `condition` is compared against the same golden source, immutable audit entry.
This means excluding a particular field in a preceding exclusion, won't impact a
subsequent condition evaluation.

### Exclusion examples

#### Exclude response data (when present)

This example does not supply a condition which means the specified fields will be
excluded from any audit entry that contains them.

```json
[
  {
    "fields": [ "/response/data" ]
  }
]
```

#### Exclude request data (when present) for transit mounts

This example uses a condition to restrict exclusion of the request data field only to
audit entries with a mount type of `transit`.

```json
[
  {
    "condition": "\"/request/mount_type\" == transit",
    "fields": [ "/request/data" ]
  }
]
```
#### Multiple exclusions

This example uses multiple exclusions to exclude:

* `data` from both the request and response when the mount type is `transit`.
* `entity_id` from requests where the `/auth/client_token` in the entry matches `hmac` and then more than one other character.

```json
[
  {
    "condition": "\"/request/mount_type\" == transit",
    "fields": [ "/request/data", "/response/data" ]
  },
  {
    "condition":  "\"/auth/client_token\" matches \"hmac.+\"",
    "fields": [ "/auth/entity_id" ]
  }
]
```

## Audit entry structure

In order to accurately construct `condition` and `fields` the Vault Operator will
have to understand the structure of the (request/response) audit entry.

This information can be obtained by reverse engineering the audit logs, however it
the following can be used to understand the structure in a more proactive way.

At a high level, there are only request audit entries and response audit entries,
each of these entries contain different objects such as `auth`, `request` and `response`.

### Request audit entry

```json
{
  "auth": <auth>,
  "error": "",
  "forwarded_from": "",
  "request": <request>,
  "time": "",
  "type": ""
}
```

### Response audit entry

```json
{
  "auth": <auth>,
  "error": "",
  "forwarded_from": "",
  "request": <request>,
  "response": <response>,
  "time": "",
  "type": ""
}
```

### Auth object (`<auth>`)

Complete with example data to show simple types (`string`, `bool`, `int`), other
JSON examples which refer to `<auth>` are referring to this object.

```json

  "entity_created": "",
  "entity_id": "",

  "token_type": ""
}
```

### Request object (`<request>`)

Complete with example data to show simple types (`string`, `bool`, `int`), other
