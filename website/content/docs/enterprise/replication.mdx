# Vault Enterprise Replication

## Overview

-> **Note**: All versions of [Vault Enterprise](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault/)
have support for Disaster Recovery replication. Performance Replication requires the
Multi-Datacenter & Scale module.

Many organizations have infrastructure that spans multiple datacenters. Vault
provides the critical services of identity management, secrets storage, and
policy management. This functionality is expected to be highly available and
to scale as the number of clients and their functional needs increase; at the
same time, operators would like to ensure that a common set of policies are
enforced globally, and a consistent set of secrets and keys are exposed to
applications that need to interoperate.

Vault replication addresses both of these needs in providing consistency,
scalability, and highly-available disaster recovery.

Note: Using replication requires a storage backend that supports transactional updates, such as Consul.

## Architecture

The core unit of Vault replication is a **cluster**, which is comprised of a
collection of Vault nodes (an active and its corresponding HA nodes). Multiple Vault
clusters communicate in a one-to-many near real-time flow.

Replication operates on a leader/follower model, wherein a leader cluster (known as a
**primary**) is linked to a series of follower **secondary** clusters. The primary
cluster acts as the system of record and asynchronously replicates most Vault data.

All communication between primaries and secondaries is end-to-end encrypted
with mutually-authenticated TLS sessions, setup via replication tokens which are
exchanged during bootstrapping.

What data is replicated between the primary and secondary depends on the type of
replication that is configured between the primary and secondary. These types
of relationships are either **disaster recovery** or **performance**
relationships.

## Performance Replication and Disaster Recovery (DR) Replication

_Performance Replication_:
In performance replication, secondaries keep track of their own tokens and leases
but share the underlying configuration, policies, and supporting secrets (K/V values,
encryption keys for `transit`, etc).

If a user action would modify underlying shared state, the secondary forwards the request
to the primary to be handled; this is transparent to the client. In practice, most
high-volume workloads (reads in the `kv` backend, encryption/decryption operations
in `transit`, etc.) can be satisfied by the local secondary, allowing Vault to scale
relatively horizontally with the number of secondaries rather than vertically as
in the past.

_Disaster Recovery (DR) Replication_:
In disaster recovery (or DR) replication, secondaries share the same underlying configuration,
policy, and supporting secrets (K/V values, encryption keys for `transit`, etc) infrastructure
as the primary. They also share the same token and lease infrastructure as the primary, as
they are designed to allow for continuous operations with applications connecting to the
original primary on the election of the DR secondary.

DR is designed to be a mechanism to protect against catastrophic failure of entire clusters.
They do not forward service read or write requests until they are elected and become a new primary.

## Primary and Secondary Cluster Compatibility

### Storage engines

There is no requirement that both clusters use the same storage engine.

### Seals

There is no requirement that both clusters use the same seal type, but see
[sealwrap](/docs/enterprise/sealwrap#seal-wrap-and-replication) for the full
details.

Also note that enabling replication will modify the secondary seal.
If the secondary uses an auto seal, its recovery configuration and keys
will be replaced; if it uses shamir, its seal configuration and unseal
keys will be replaced. Here seal/recovery configuration means the number of
seal/recovery key fragments and the required threshold of those
fragments.

| Primary seal | Secondary seal | Impact on secondary of enabling replication                                                |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Shamir       | Shamir         | Seal config and unseal keys replaced with primary's                                        |
| Shamir       | Auto           | Seal recovery config and recovery keys replaced with primary's seal config and unseal keys |
| Auto         | Auto           | Seal recovery config and recovery keys replaced with primary's                             |
| Auto         | Shamir         | Seal config and unseal keys replaced with primary's recovery seal config and recovery keys |

### Vault versions

Vault changes are designed and tested to ensure that the
[upgrade instructions](/docs/upgrading#replication-installations) are viable, i.e.
that a secondary can run a newer Vault version than its primary.

That said, we do not recommend running replicated Vault clusters with different
versions any longer than necessary to perform the upgrade.

## Internals

Details on the internal design of the replication feature can be found in the
[replication internals](/docs/internals/replication) document.

## Security Model

Vault is trusted all over the world to keep secrets safe. As such, we have put
extreme focus to detail to our replication model as well.

### Primary/Secondary Communication

When a cluster is marked as the primary it generates a self-signed CA
certificate. On request, and given a user-specified identifier, the primary
uses this CA certificate to generate a private key and certificate and packages
these, along with some other information, into a replication bootstrapping
bundle, a.k.a. a secondary activation token. The certificate is used to perform
TLS mutual authentication between the primary and that secondary.

This CA certificate is never shared with secondaries, and no secondary ever has
access to any other secondary’s certificate. In practice this means that
revoking a secondary’s access to the primary does not allow it continue
replication with any other machine; it also means that if a primary goes down,
there is full administrative control over which cluster becomes primary. An
attacker cannot spoof a secondary into believing that a cluster the attacker
controls is the new primary without also being able to administratively direct
the secondary to connect by giving it a new bootstrap package (which is an
ACL-protected call).

Vault makes use of Application Layer Protocol Negotiation on its cluster port.
This allows the same port to handle both request forwarding and replication,
even while keeping the certificate root of trust and feature set different.

### Secondary Activation Tokens

A secondary activation token is an extremely sensitive item and as such is
protected via response wrapping. Experienced Vault users will note that the
wrapping format for replication bootstrap packages is different from normal
response wrapping tokens: it is a signed JWT. This allows the replication token
to carry the redirect address of the primary cluster as part of the token. In
most cases this means that simply providing the token to a new secondary is
enough to activate replication, although this can also be overridden when the
token is provided to the secondary.

Secondary activation tokens should be treated like Vault root tokens. If
disclosed to a bad actor, that actor can gain access to all Vault data. It
should therefore be treated with utmost sensitivity. Like all
response-wrapping tokens, once the token is used successfully (in this case, to
activate a secondary) it is useless, so it is only necessary to safeguard it
from one machine to the next. Like with root tokens, HashiCorp recommends that
when a secondary activation token is live, there are multiple eyes on it from
generation until it is used.

Once a secondary is activated, its cluster information is stored safely behind
its encrypted barrier.
