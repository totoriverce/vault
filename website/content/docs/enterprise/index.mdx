# Vault Enterprise

Vault Enterprise includes a number of features that may be useful in specific
workflows. Please use the sidebar navigation on the left to choose a specific
topic.

These features are part of [Vault Enterprise](https://www.hashicorp.com/vault?utm_source=oss&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=vault&_ga=1.201793489.1956619674.1489356624).

## Vault Enterprise Licenses

A Vault Enterprise license needs to be applied to a Vault cluster
in order to use Vault Enterprise features.

The license can be applied to a cluster from any server in it with this command.

```shell-session
$ vault write sys/license text="01MV4UU43BK5HGYYTOJZWFQM..."
```

You could also use the Vault HTTP API against the [`sys/license`](/api-docs/system/license)
endpoint.
