# Install Vault

There are several approaches to installing Vault:

1. Install a [Linux package](#linux-package)

1. Use a [precompiled binary](#precompiled-binaries)

1. Install [from source](#compiling-from-source)

Installing a Linux package is the easiest. If you develop or deploy on another
platform, the precompiled binary will be easiest. We provide downloads over TLS
along with SHA256 sums to verify the binary. We also distribute a PGP signature
with the SHA256 sums that can be verified.

## Linux Package

We build and sign official packages for Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, RHEL, Amazon
Linux, and other distributions. Follow the instructions at [HashiCorp
Learn][learn-vault-install] to add our GPG key, add our repository, and
install.

## Precompiled Binaries

To install the precompiled binary, [download](/downloads) the appropriate
package for your system. Vault is currently packaged as a zip file.

Once the zip is downloaded, unzip it into any directory. The `vault` binary
inside is all that is necessary to run Vault (or `vault.exe` for Windows). No
additional files are required to run Vault.

Copy the binary to anywhere on your system. If you intend to access it from the
command-line, make sure to place it somewhere on your `PATH`.

Continue on to [HashiCorp Learn][learn-vault-dev-server] to start a server, `put`
your first secret, and use other features of Vault.

## Compiling from Source

To compile from source, you will need [Go](https://golang.org) installed and
configured properly (including a `GOPATH` environment variable set), as well as
a copy of [`git`](https://www.git-scm.com/) in your `PATH`.

Clone the Vault repository from GitHub into your `GOPATH`:

```shell
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp && cd $_
$ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/vault.git
$ cd vault
```

Bootstrap the project. This will download and compile libraries and tools needed
to compile Vault:

```shell
$ make bootstrap
```

Build Vault for your current system and put the binary in `./bin/` (relative to
the git checkout). The `make dev` target is just a shortcut that builds `vault`
for only your local build environment (no cross-compiled targets).

```shell
$ make dev
```

## Verifying the Installation

To verify Vault is properly installed, run `vault -h` on your system. You should
see help output. If you are executing it from the command line, make sure it is
on your PATH or you may get an error about Vault not being found.

```shell-session
$ vault -h
```
