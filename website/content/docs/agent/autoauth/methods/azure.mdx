# Vault Agent Auto-Auth Azure Method

The `azure` method reads in Azure instance credentials and uses them to
authenticate with the [Azure Auth
method](/docs/auth/azure). It reads most
parameters needed for authentication directly from instance information based
on the value of the `resource` parameter.

## Configuration

- `role` `(string: required)` - The role to authenticate against on Vault

- `resource` `(string: required)` - The resource name to use when getting instance information
