# Telemetry

The Vault server process collects various runtime metrics about the performance of different libraries and subsystems. These metrics are aggregated on a ten-second interval and retained for one minute in memory. Telemetry from Vault must be stored in metrics aggregation software to monitor Vault and collect durable metrics.

To view the raw data, you must send a signal to the Vault process: on Unix-style operating systems, this is `USR1`, while on Windows, it is `BREAK`. When the Vault process receives this signal, it will dump the current telemetry information to the process's `stderr`.

This telemetry information can be used for debugging purposes and provides users with insights into Vault's runtime.

Telemetry information can also be streamed directly from Vault to a range of metrics aggregation solutions as described in the [telemetry Stanza][telemetry-stanza] documentation.

The following is an example of a telemetry dump snippet:

You'll note that log entries are prefixed with the metric type as follows:

- **[C]** is a counter. Counters are cumulative metrics that are incremented when some event occurs, and resets at the end of reporting intervals. Vault retains counters and other metrics for one minute in-memory, so an [aggregation solution][telemetry-stanza] must be configured to see accurate and persistent counters over time.
- **[G]** is a gauge. Gauges provide measurements of current values.
- **[S]** is a summary. Summaries provide sample observations of values. Vault commonly uses summaries for measuring the timing duration of discrete events in the reporting interval.

The following sections describe the available Vault metrics. The metrics interval are approximately 10 seconds when manually triggering metrics output using the above-described signals. Some high-cardinality gauges, like `vault.kv.secret.count`, are emitted every 10 minutes, or at an interval configured in the `telemetry` stanza.

Some Vault metrics come with additional [labels](#metric-labels) describing the measurement in more detail, such as the namespace in which an operation takes place or the auth method used to create a token. This additional information is incorporated into the metrics name in the in-memory telemetry or other telemetry engines that do not support labels. The metric name in the table below is followed by a list of labels supported, in the order in which they appear, if flattened.

## Audit Metrics

These metrics relate to auditing.

| Metric                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Unit     | Type    |

| `vault.audit.log_response`         | Duration of time taken by audit log responses across all audit log devices                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | ms       | summary |
| `vault.audit.log_request_failure`  | Number of audit log request failures. **NOTE**: This is a crucial metric. A non-zero value here indicates that there was a failure to send an audit log request to a configured audit log devices occured. If Vault cannot log into a configured audit log device, it ceases all user operations. When this metric increases regularly, it is suggested to troubleshoot the audit log devices immediately.             | failures | counter |
| `vault.audit.log_response_failure` | Number of audit log response failures. **NOTE**: This is a crucial metric. A non-zero value here indicates that there was a failure to receive a response to a request made to one of the configured audit log devices occured. When Vault cannot log to a configured audit log devices, it ceases all user operations. Troubleshooting the audit log devices is suggested when a consistent value of this metric is evaluated. | failures | counter |

**NOTE:** In addition, there are audit metrics for each enabled audit device represented as `vault.audit.<type>.log_request`. For example, if a file audit device is enabled, its metrics would be `vault.audit.file.log_request` and `vault.audit.file.log_response` .

## Core Metrics

These metrics represent operational aspects of the running Vault instance.

## Policy Metrics

These metrics report measurements of the time spent performing policy operations.

| `vault.expire.leases.by_expiration` (cluster,gauge,expiring,namespace)                          | The number of leases set to expire, grouped by a time interval. This specific time interval and the total number of time intervals are configurable via `lease_metrics_epsilon` and `num_lease_metrics_buckets` in the telemetry stanza of a vault server configuration. The default values for these are `1hr` and `168` respectively, so the metric will report the number of leases that will expire each hour from the current time to a week from the present time. You can additionally group lease expiration by namespace by setting `add_lease_metrics_namespace_labels` to `true` in the config file (default is `false`). | leases   | gauge   |

## Integrated Storage (Raft) Autopilot

| Metric                              | Description                                                                                           | Unit  | Type  |
| :---------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---- | :---- |
| `vault.autopilot.node.healthy`      | Set to 1 if the node_id is deemed healthy by Autopilot, 0 if not                                      | bool  | gauge |
| `vault.autopilot.healthy`           | Set to 1 if Autopilot considers all nodes healthy                                                     | bool  | gauge |
| `vault.autopilot.failure_tolerance` | How many nodes can be lost while maintaining quorum, i.e., number of healthy nodes in excess of quorum | nodes | gauge |

Since Autopilot runs only on the active node, these metrics are emitted by the active node only.

## Integrated Storage (Raft) Leadership Changes

| Metric                          | Description                                                                                                   | Unit      | Type    |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------- | :------ |
| `vault.raft.leader.lastContact` | Measures the time since the leader was last able to contact the follower nodes when checking its leader lease | ms        | summary |
| `vault.raft.state.candidate`    | Increments whenever raft server starts an election                                                            | Elections | counter |
| `vault.raft.state.leader`       | Increments whenever raft server becomes a leader                                                              | Leaders   | counter |

**Why are they vital?**: If frequent elections or leadership changes occur, it would likely indicate network issues between the raft nodes or the raft servers cannot keep up with the load.

**What to look for**: For a healthy cluster, you're looking for a lastContact
lower than 200ms, leader > 0 and candidate == 0. Deviations from this might
indicate flapping leadership.
