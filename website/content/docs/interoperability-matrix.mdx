# Vault Interoperability Matrix

Vault integrates with various appliances, platforms and applications for different use cases. Below are two tables indicating the partner’s product that has been verified to work with Vault for [Auto Unsealing](/vault/docs/concepts/seal#auto-unseal) / [HSM Support](/vault/docs/enterprise/hsm) and [External Key Management](https://vaultproject.io/use-cases/key-management).

Auto Unseal and HSM Support was developed to aid in reducing the operational complexity of keeping the unseal key secure. This feature delegates the responsibility of securing the unseal key from users to a trusted device or service. At startup Vault will connect to the device or service implementing the seal and ask it to decrypt the root key Vault read from storage.

Vault centrally manages and automates encryption keys across environments allowing customers to control their own encryption keys used in third party services or products.

## Vault Seal and HSM Interoperability

The below table shows the partner product and if the partner’s technology works with each individual seal component.

| Partner           | Product                                | Auto Unseal <br/> (Vault 0.9+)  | Entropy Augmentation <br/>(Vault 1.3+) | Seal Wrap  <br/>(Vault 0.9+)   | Managed Keys  <br/> (Vault 1.10+) | Min. Vault Version Verified |
