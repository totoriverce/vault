# operator raft

This command groups subcommands for operators to manage the integrated Raft storage backend.

```text
Usage: vault operator raft <subcommand> [options] [args]

 This command groups subcommands for operators interacting with the Vault
 integrated Raft storage backend. Most users will not need to interact with these
 commands. Here are a few examples of the Raft operator commands:

Subcommands:
    join           Joins a node to the Raft cluster
    list-peers     Returns the Raft peer set
    remove-peer    Removes a node from the Raft cluster
    snapshot       Restores and saves snapshots from the Raft cluster
```

## join

This command is used to join a new node as a peer to the Raft cluster. In order
to join, there must be at least one existing member of the cluster. If Shamir
seal is in use, then unseal keys are to be supplied before or after the
join process, depending on whether it's being used exclusively for HA.

If raft is used for `storage`, the node must be joined before unsealing and the
`leader-api-addr` argument must be provided. If raft is used for `ha_storage`,
the node must be first unsealed before joining and the `leader-api-addr` must
_not_ be provided.

```text
Usage: vault operator raft join [options] <leader-api-addr>

  Join the current node as a peer to the Raft cluster by providing the address
  of the Raft leader node.

	  $ vault operator raft join "http://127.0.0.2:8200"
```

The `join` command also allows operators to specify cloud auto-join configuration
instead of a static IP address or hostname. When provided, Vault will attempt to
automatically discover and resolve potential leader addresses based on the provided
auto-join configuration.

Vault uses go-discover to support the auto-join functionality. Please see the
go-discover
[README](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-discover/blob/master/README.md) for
details on the format.

By default, Vault will attempt to reach discovered peers using HTTPS and port 8200.
Operators may override these through the `--auto-join-scheme` and `--auto-join-port`
CLI flags respectively.

```text
Usage: vault operator raft join [options] <auto-join-configuration>
  Join the current node as a peer to the Raft cluster by providing cloud auto-join
  metadata configuration.
    $ vault operator raft join "provider=aws region=eu-west-1 ..."
```

### Parameters

The following flags are available for the `operator raft join` command.

- `-leader-ca-cert` `(string: "")` - CA cert to communicate with Raft leader.

- `-leader-client-cert` `(string: "")` - Client cert to to authenticate to Raft leader.

- `-leader-client-key` `(string: "")` - Client key to to authenticate to Raft leader.

- `-non-voter` `(bool: false) (enterprise)` - This flag is used to make the
  server not participate in the Raft quorum, and have it only receive the data
  replication stream. This can be used to add read scalability to a cluster in
  cases where a high volume of reads to servers are needed. The default is false.

- `-retry` `(bool: false)` - Continuously retry joining the Raft cluster upon
  failures. The default is false.

## list-peers

This command is used to list the full set of peers in the Raft cluster.

```text
Usage: vault operator raft list-peers

  Provides the details of all the peers in the Raft cluster.

	  $ vault operator raft list-peers
```

### Example Output

```json
{
 ...
  "data": {
    "config": {
      "index": 62,
      "servers": [
        {
          "address": "127.0.0.2:8201",
          "leader": true,
          "node_id": "node1",
          "protocol_version": "3",
          "voter": true
        },
        {
          "address": "127.0.0.4:8201",
          "leader": false,
          "node_id": "node3",
          "protocol_version": "3",
          "voter": true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## remove-peer

This command is used to remove a node from being a peer to the Raft cluster. In
certain cases where a peer may be left behind in the Raft configuration even
though the server is no longer present and known to the cluster, this command
can be used to remove the failed server so that it is no longer affects the Raft
quorum.

```text
Usage: vault operator raft remove-peer <server_id>

  Removes a node from the Raft cluster.

	  $ vault operator raft remove-peer node1
```

## snapshot

This command groups subcommands for operators interacting with the snapshot
functionality of the integrated Raft storage backend. There are 2 subcommands
supported: `save` and `restore`.

```text
Usage: vault operator raft snapshot <subcommand> [options] [args]

  This command groups subcommands for operators interacting with the snapshot
  functionality of the integrated Raft storage backend.

Subcommands:
    restore    Installs the provided snapshot, returning the cluster to the state defined in it
    save       Saves a snapshot of the current state of the Raft cluster into a file
```

### snapshot save

Takes a snapshot of the Vault data. The snapshot can be used to restore Vault to
the point in time when a snapshot was taken.

```text
Usage: vault operator raft snapshot save <snapshot_file>

  Saves a snapshot of the current state of the Raft cluster into a file.

	  $ vault operator raft snapshot save raft.snap
```

~> **Note:** Snapshot is not supported when Raft is used only for `ha_storage`.

### snapshot restore

Restores a snapshot of Vault data taken with `vault operator raft snapshot save`.

```text
Usage: vault operator raft snapshot restore <snapshot_file>

  Installs the provided snapshot, returning the cluster to the state defined in it.

	  $ vault operator raft snapshot restore raft.snap
```

## autopilot

This command groups subcommands for operators interacting with the autopilot
functionality of the integrated Raft storage backend. There are 3 subcommands
supported: `get-config`, `set-config` and `state`.

For a more detailed overview of autopilot features, see the [concepts page](/docs/concepts/integrated-storage/autopilot).

```text
Usage: vault operator raft autopilot <subcommand> [options] [args]

This command groups subcommands for operators interacting with the autopilot
functionality of the integrated Raft storage backend.

Subcommands:
    get-config    Returns the configuration of the autopilot subsystem under integrated storage
    set-config    Modify the configuration of the autopilot subsystem under integrated storage
    state         Displays the state of the raft cluster under integrated storage as seen by autopilot
```

### autopilot state

Displays the state of the raft cluster under integrated storage as seen by
autopilot. It shows whether autopilot thinks the cluster is healthy or not,
and how many nodes could fail before the cluster becomes unhealthy ("Failure Tolerance").

State includes a list of all servers by nodeID and IP address. Last Index
indicates how close the state on each node is to the leader's.

A node can have a status of "leader", "voter", and
"[non-voter](/docs/concepts/integrated-storage#non-voting-nodes-enterprise-only)".

```text
Usage: vault operator raft autopilot state

  Displays the state of the raft cluster under integrated storage as seen by autopilot.

    $ vault operator raft autopilot state
```

#### Example Output

```text
Healthy:                      true
Failure Tolerance:            1

### autopilot get-config

Returns the configuration of the autopilot subsystem under integrated storage.

```text
Usage: vault operator raft autopilot get-config

  Returns the configuration of the autopilot subsystem under integrated storage.

    $ vault operator raft autopilot get-config
```

### autopilot set-config

Modify the configuration of the autopilot subsystem under integrated storage.

```text
Usage: vault operator raft autopilot set-config [options]

  Modify the configuration of the autopilot subsystem under integrated storage.

	  $ vault operator raft autopilot set-config -server-stabilization-time 10s

```

Flags applicable to this command are the following:

- `cleanup-dead-servers` `(bool)` - Controls whether to remove dead servers from
  the Raft peer list periodically or when a new server joins. This requires that
  `min-quorum` is also set.

- `last-contact-threshold` `(string)` - Limit on the amount of time a server can
  go without leader contact before being considered unhealthy.

- `dead-server-last-contact-threshold` `(string)` - Limit on the amount of time
  a server can go without leader contact before being considered failed. This
  takes effect only when `cleanup_dead_servers` is set.

- `max-trailing-logs` `(int)` - Amount of entries in the Raft Log that a server
  can be behind before being considered unhealthy.

- `min-quorum` `(int)` - Minimum number of servers allowed in a cluster before
  autopilot can prune dead servers. This should at least be 3. Applicable only for
  voting nodes.

- `server-stabilization-time` `(string)` - Minimum amount of time a server must be in a stable, healthy state before it can become a voter. Until that happens, it will be visible as a peer in the cluster, but as a non-voter, meaning it won't contribute to quorum.
