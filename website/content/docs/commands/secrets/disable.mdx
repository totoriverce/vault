# secrets disable

The `secrets disable` command disables an secrets engine at a given PATH. The
argument corresponds to the enabled PATH of the engine, not the TYPE! All
secrets created by this engine are revoked and its Vault data is removed.

When a secrets engine is disabled, **all secrets generated via the secrets
engine are immediately revoked.** Care should be taken when disabling a
secret mount with a large number of secrets, as it can cause a high load on
the system during revocation time.

## Examples

Disable the secrets engine enabled at aws/:

```shell-session
$ vault secrets disable aws/
```

## Usage

There are no flags beyond the [standard set of flags](/docs/commands)
included on all commands.
