# auth enable

The `auth enable` command enables an auth method at a given path. If an auth
method already exists at the given path, an error is returned. After the auth
method is enabled, it usually needs configuration. The configuration varies by
auth method.

An auth method is responsible for authenticating users or machines and assigning
them policies and a token with which they can access Vault. Authentication is
usually mapped to policy. Please see the [policies
concepts](/docs/concepts/policies) page for more information.

## Examples

Enable the auth method "userpass" enabled at "userpass/":

```shell-session
$ vault auth enable userpass
Success! Enabled the userpass auth method at: userpass/
```

Create a user:

```shell-session
$ vault write auth/userpass/users/sethvargo password=secret
Success! Data written to: auth/userpass/users/sethvargo
```

For more information on the specific configuration options and paths, please see
the [auth method](/docs/auth) documentation.

## Usage

The following flags are available in addition to the [standard set of
flags](/docs/commands) included on all commands.

- `-audit-non-hmac-request-keys` `(string: "")` - Key that will not be HMAC'd
  by audit devices in the request data object. Note that multiple keys may be
  specified by providing this option multiple times, each time with 1 key.
  An example of this is provided in the [tune section](/docs/commands/auth/tune).

- `-audit-non-hmac-response-keys` `(string: "")` - Key that will not be HMAC'd
  by audit devices in the response data object. Note that multiple keys may be
  specified by providing this option multiple times, each time with 1 key.

- `-default-lease-ttl` `(duration: "")` - The default lease TTL for this auth
  method. If unspecified, this defaults to the Vault server's globally
  configured default lease TTL, or a previously configured value for the auth
  method.

- `-description` `(string: "")` - Human-friendly description for the purpose of
  this auth method.

- `-local` `(bool: false)` - Mark the auth method as local-only. Local auth
  methods are not replicated nor removed by replication.

- `-path` `(string: "")` - Place where the auth method will be accessible. This
  must be unique across all auth methods. This defaults to the "type" of the
  auth method. The auth method will be accessible at `/auth/<path>`.
