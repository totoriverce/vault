# Annotations

The following are the available annotations for the injector. These annotations
are organized into two sections: agent and vault. All of the annotations below
change the configurations of the Vault Agent containers injected into the pod.

## Agent Annotations

Agent annotations change the Vault Agent containers templating configuration. For
example, agent annotations allow users to define what secrets they want, how to render
them, optional commands to run, etc.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject` - configures whether injection is explicitly
  enabled or disabled for a pod. This should be set to a `true` or `false` value.
  Defaults to `false`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-status` - blocks further mutations
  by adding the value `injected` to the pod after a successful mutation.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-configmap` - name of the configuration map where Vault
  Agent configuration file and templates can be found.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-image` - name of the Vault docker image to use. This
  value overrides the default image configured in the controller and is usually
  not needed. Defaults to `vault:1.7.2`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-init-first` - configures the pod to run the Vault Agent
  init container first if `true` (last if `false`). This is useful when other init
  containers need pre-populated secrets. This should be set to a `true` or `false`
  value. Defaults to `false`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-command` - configures Vault Agent
  to run a command after the template has been rendered. To map a command to a specific
  secret, use the same unique secret name: `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-command-SECRET-NAME`.
  For example, if a secret annotation `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-foobar`
  is configured, `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-command-foobar` would map a command
  to that secret.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret` - configures Vault Agent
  to retrieve the secrets from Vault required by the container. The name of the
  secret is any unique string after `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-`,
  such as `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-foobar`. The value is the path
  in Vault where the secret is located.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template` - configures the template Vault Agent
  should use for rendering a secret. The name of the template is any
  unique string after `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template-`, such as
  `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template-foobar`. This should map to the same
  unique value provided in `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-`. If not provided,
  a default generic template is used.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/secret-volume-path` - configures where on the filesystem a secret
  will be rendered. To map a path to a specific secret, use the same unique secret name:
  `vault.hashicorp.com/secret-volume-path-SECRET-NAME`. For example, if a secret annotation
  `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-foobar` is configured,
  `vault.hashicorp.com/secret-volume-path-foobar` would configure where that secret
  is rendered. If no secret name is provided, this sets the default for all rendered
  secrets in the pod.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-file` - configures the filename and path
  in the secrets volume where a Vault secret will be written. This should be used
  with `vault.hashicorp.com/secret-volume-path`, which mounts a memory volume to
  the specified path. If `secret-volume-path` is used, the path can be omitted from
  this value. To map a filename to a specific secret, use the same unique secret name:
  `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-file-SECRET-NAME`. For example, if a secret annotation
  `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-foobar` is configured,
  `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-file-foobar` would configure the filename.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template-file` - configures the path and filename of the 
  custom template to use. This should be used with `vault.hashicorp.com/extra-secret`, 
  which mounts a Kubernetes secret to `/vault/custom`. To map a template file to a specific secret, 
  use the same unique secret name: `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template-file-SECRET-NAME`. 
  For example, if a secret annotation `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-foobar` is configured,
  `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-template-file-foobar` would configure the template file.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-default-template` - configures the default template type for rendering 
  secrets if no custom template is defined. Possible values include `map` and `json`. Defaults to `map`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-extra-secret` - mounts Kubernetes secret as a volume at
  `/vault/custom` in the sidecar/init containers. Useful for custom Agent configs with
  auto-auth methods such as approle that require paths to secrets be present.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-token` - configures Vault Agent to share the Vault
  token with other containers in the pod. This is helpful when other containers
  communicate directly with Vault but require auto-authentication provided by Vault
  Agent. This should be set to a `true` or `false` value. Defaults to `false`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-limits-cpu` - configures the CPU limits on the Vault
  Agent containers. Defaults to `500m`. Setting this to an empty string disables
  CPU limits.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-limits-mem` - configures the memory limits on the Vault
  Agent containers. Defaults to `128Mi`. Setting this to an empty string disables
  memory limits.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-requests-cpu` - configures the CPU requests on the
  Vault Agent containers. Defaults to `250m`. Setting this to an empty string disables
  CPU requests.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-requests-mem` - configures the memory requests on the
  Vault Agent containers. Defaults to `64Mi`. Setting this to an empty string disables
  memory requests.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-revoke-on-shutdown` - configures whether the sidecar
  will revoke it's own token before shutting down. This setting will only be applied
  to the Vault Agent sidecar container. This should be set to a `true` or `false`
  value. Defaults to `false`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-revoke-grace` - configures the grace period, in seconds,
  for revoking it's own token before shutting down. This setting will only be applied
  to the Vault Agent sidecar container. Defaults to `5s`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-pre-populate` - configures whether an init container
  is included to pre-populate the shared memory volume with secrets prior to the
  containers starting.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-pre-populate-only` - configures whether an init container
  is the only injected container. If true, no sidecar container will be injected
  at runtime of the pod.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/preserve-secret-case` - configures Vault Agent to preserve
  the secret name case when creating the secret files. This should be set to a `true`
  or `false` value. Defaults to `false`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-run-as-user` - sets the user (uid) to run Vault
  agent as. Also available as a command-line option (`-run-as-user`) or
  environment variable (`AGENT_INJECT_RUN_AS_USER`) for the injector. Defaults
  to 100.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-run-as-group` - sets the group (gid) to run Vault
  agent as. Also available as a command-line option (`-run-as-group`) or
  environment variable (`AGENT_INJECT_RUN_AS_GROUP`) for the injector. Defaults
  to 1000.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-set-security-context` - controls whether
  `SecurityContext` is set in injected containers. Also available as a
  command-line option (`-set-security-context`) or environment variable
  (`AGENT_INJECT_SET_SECURITY_CONTEXT`). Defaults to `true`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-run-as-same-user` - run the injected Vault agent
  containers as the User (uid) of the first application container in the pod.
  Requires `Spec.Containers[0].SecurityContext.RunAsUser` to be set in the pod
  spec. Also available as a command-line option (`-run-as-same-user`) or
  environment variable (`AGENT_INJECT_RUN_AS_SAME_USER`). Defaults to `false`.

  ~> **Note**: If the first application container in the pod is running as root
  (uid 0), the `run-as-same-user` annotation will fail injection with an error.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-cache-enable` - configures Vault Agent to enable
  [caching](/docs/agent/caching). In Vault 1.7+ this annotation will also enable
  a Vault Agent persistent cache. This persistent cache will be shared between the init
  and sidecar container to reuse tokens and leases retrieved by the init container.
  Defaults to `false`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-cache-use-auto-auth-token` - configures Vault Agent cache
  to authenticate on behalf of the requester. Set to `force` to enable. Disabled
  by default.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-cache-listener-port` - configures Vault Agent cache
  listening port. Defaults to `8080`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-copy-volume-mounts` - copies the mounts from the specified
  container and mounts them to the Vault Agent containers. The service account volume is
  ignored.

## Vault Annotations

Vault annotations change how the Vault Agent containers communicate with Vault. For
example, Vault's address, TLS certificates to use, client parameters such as timeouts,
etc.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/auth-config` - configures additional parameters for the configured
  authentication method. The name of the config is any unique string after
  `vault.hashicorp.com/auth-config-`, such as `vault.hashicorp.com/auth-config-role-id-file-path`.
  This annotation can be reused multiple times to configure multiple settings for the authentication
  method. Some authentication methods may require additional secrets and should be mounted via the
  `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-extra-secret` annotation. For a list of valid authentication configurations,
  see the Vault Agent [auto-auth documentation](/docs/agent/autoauth/methods).

- `vault.hashicorp.com/auth-path` - configures the authentication path for the Kubernetes
  auth method. Defaults to `auth/kubernetes`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/auth-type` - configures the authentication type for Vault Agent.
  Defaults to `kubernetes`. For a list of valid authentication methods, see the Vault Agent
  [auto-auth documentation](/docs/agent/autoauth/methods).

- `vault.hashicorp.com/ca-cert` - path of the CA certificate used to verify Vault's
  TLS.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/ca-key` - path of the CA public key used to verify Vault's
  TLS.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/client-cert` - path of the client certificate used when
  communicating with Vault via mTLS.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/client-key` - path of the client public key used when communicating
  with Vault via mTLS.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/client-max-retries` - configures number of Vault Agent retry
  attempts when 5xx errors are encountered. Defaults to 2.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/client-timeout` - configures the request timeout threshold,
  in seconds, of the Vault Agent when communicating with Vault. Defaults to `60s`
  and accepts value types of `60`, `60s` or `1m`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/log-level` - configures the verbosity of the Vault Agent
  log level. Default is `info`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/log-format` - configures the log type for Vault Agent. Possible
  values are `standard` and `json`. Default is `standard`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/namespace` - configures the Vault Enterprise namespace to
  be used when requesting secrets from Vault.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/proxy-address` - configures the HTTP proxy to use when connecting
  to a Vault server.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/role` - configures the Vault role used by the Vault Agent
  auto-auth method. Required when `vault.hashicorp.com/agent-configmap` is not set.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/service` - name of the Vault service to use. This value
  overrides the default service configured in the controller and is usually not
  needed.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/tls-secret` - name of the Kubernetes secret containing TLS
  Client and CA certificates and keys. This is mounted to `/vault/tls`.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/tls-server-name` - name of the Vault server to verify the
  authenticity of the server when communicating with Vault over TLS.

- `vault.hashicorp.com/tls-skip-verify` - if true, configures the Vault Agent to
  skip verification of Vault's TLS certificate. It's not recommended to set this
  value to true in a production environment.
