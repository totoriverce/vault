# Helm Chart

~> **Important Note:** This chart is not compatible with Helm 2. Please use Helm 3 with this chart.

The [Vault Helm chart](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-helm)
is the recommended way to install and configure Vault on Kubernetes.
In addition to running Vault itself, the Helm chart is the primary
method for installing and configuring Vault to integrate with other
services such as Consul for High Availability (HA) deployments.

This page assumes general knowledge of [Helm](https://helm.sh/) and
how to use it. Using Helm to install Vault requires that Helm is
properly installed and configured with your Kubernetes cluster.

## Using the Helm Chart

Helm must be installed and configured on your machine. Please refer to the [Helm
documentation](https://helm.sh/) or the [Vault Installation to Minikube via
Helm](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/kubernetes-minikube) guide.

To use the Helm chart, add the Hashicorp helm repository and check that you have
access to the chart:

```shell-session
$ helm repo add hashicorp https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com
"hashicorp" has been added to your repositories

$ helm search repo hashicorp/vault
NAME           	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION
hashicorp/vault	0.13.0       	1.7.3      	Official HashiCorp Vault Chart
```

-> **Important:** The Helm chart is new and under significant development.
Please always run Helm with `--dry-run` before any install or upgrade to verify
changes.

Example chart usage:

Installing the latest release of the Vault Helm chart with pods prefixed with
the name `vault`.

```shell-session
$ helm install vault hashicorp/vault
```

Installing a specific version of the chart.

```sh
# List the available releases
$ helm search repo hashicorp/vault -l
NAME           	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION
hashicorp/vault	0.13.0       	1.7.3      	Official HashiCorp Vault Chart
hashicorp/vault	0.12.0       	1.7.2      	Official HashiCorp Vault Chart
hashicorp/vault	0.11.0       	1.7.0      	Official HashiCorp Vault Chart
hashicorp/vault	0.10.0       	1.7.0      	Official HashiCorp Vault Chart
hashicorp/vault	0.9.1        	1.6.2      	Official HashiCorp Vault Chart
hashicorp/vault	0.9.0        	1.6.1      	Official HashiCorp Vault Chart
hashicorp/vault	0.8.0        	1.5.4      	Official HashiCorp Vault Chart
hashicorp/vault	0.7.0        	1.5.2      	Official HashiCorp Vault Chart

# Install version 0.13.0
$ helm install vault hashicorp/vault --version 0.13.0
```

~> **Security Warning:** By default, the chart runs in standalone mode. This
mode uses a single Vault server with a file storage backend. This is a less
secure and less resilient installation that is **NOT** appropriate for a
production setup. It is highly recommended to use a [properly secured Kubernetes
cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/securing-a-cluster/),
[learn the available configuration
options](/docs/platform/k8s/helm/configuration), and read the [production deployment
checklist](/docs/platform/k8s/helm/run#architecture).

## Learn

Kubernetes](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/vault/kubernetes)
guides for step-by-step tutorials.
