# Configuration

~> **Important Note:** This chart is not compatible with Helm 2. Please use Helm 3 with this chart.

The chart is highly customizable using
[Helm configuration values](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#customizing-the-chart-before-installing).
Each value has a default tuned for an optimal getting started experience
with Vault. Before going into production, please review the parameters below
and consider if they're appropriate for your deployment.

- `global` - These global values affect multiple components of the chart.

  - `enabled` (`boolean: true`) - The master enabled/disabled configuration. If this is true, most components will be installed by default. If this is false, no components will be installed by default and manually opting-in is required, such as by setting `server.enabled` to true.

  - `imagePullSecrets` (`array: []`) - References secrets to be used when pulling images from private registries. See [Pull an Image from a Private Registry](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/) for more details.

    - `name`: (`string: required`) - Name of the secret containing files required for authentication to private image registries.

  - `tlsDisable` (`boolean: true`) - When set to `true`, changes URLs from `https` to `http` (such as the `VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200` environment variable set on the Vault pods).

  - `openshift` (`boolean: false`) - If `true`, enables configuration specific to OpenShift such as NetworkPolicy, SecurityContext, and Route.

  - `psp` - Values that configure Pod Security Policy.

    - `enable` (`boolean: false`) - When set to `true`, enables Pod Security Policies for Vault and Vault Agent Injector.

    - `annotations` (`dictionary: {}`) - This value defines additional annotations to
      add to the Pod Security Policies. This can either be YAML or a YAML-formatted
      multi-line templated string.

      ```yaml
      annotations:
        seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: docker/default,runtime/default
        apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: runtime/default
        seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName:  runtime/default
        apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName:  runtime/default
      # or
      annotations: |
        seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: docker/default,runtime/default
        apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: runtime/default
        seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName:  runtime/default
        apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName:  runtime/default
      ```

- `injector` - Values that configure running a Vault Agent Injector Admission Webhook Controller within Kubernetes.

  - `enabled` (`boolean: true`) - When set to `true`, the Vault Agent Injector Admission Webhook controller will be created.

  - `externalVaultAddr` (`string: ""`) - External vault server address for the injector to use. Setting this will disable deployment of the vault server, and only deploy the injector.
    A service account with token review permissions is automatically created if `server.serviceAccount.create=true` is set for the external Vault server to use.

  - `replicas` (`int: 1`) - The number of pods to deploy to create a highly available cluster of Vault Agent Injectors. Requires Vault K8s 0.7.0 to have more than 1 replica.

  - `leaderElector` - Values that configure the Vault Agent Injector leader election for HA deployments.

    - `enabled` (`boolean: true`) - When set to `true`, enables leader election for Vault Agent Injector. This is required when using auto-tls and more than 1 replica.

    - `image` - Values that configure the Vault Agent Injector Leader Election image.

      - `repository` (`string: "gcr.io/google_containers/leader-elector"`) - The name of the leader election image for the Vault Agent Injector.

      - `tag` (`string: "0.4"`) - The tag of the Docker image for the Leader Election. **This should be pinned to a specific version when running in production.**

    - `tag` (`string: "0.10.2"`) - The tag of the Docker image for the Vault Agent Injector. **This should be pinned to a specific version when running in production.** Otherwise, other changes to the chart may inadvertently upgrade your admission controller.

    - `pullPolicy` (`string: "IfNotPresent"`) - The pull policy for container images. The default pull policy is `IfNotPresent` which causes the Kubelet to skip pulling an image if it already exists.

  - `agentImage` - Values that configure the Vault Agent sidecar image.

    - `repository` (`string: "vault"`) - The name of the Docker image for the Vault Agent sidecar. This should be set to the official Vault Docker image.

  - `revokeOnShutdown` (`boolean: false`) - Configures all Vault Agent sidecars to revoke their token when shutting down.

  - `resources` (`dictionary: {}`) - The resource requests and limits (CPU, memory, etc.) for each container of the server. This should be a YAML dictionary of a Kubernetes [ResourceRequirements](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.15/#resourcerequirements-v1-core) object. If this isn't specified, then the pods won't request any specific amount of resources, which limits the ability for Kubernetes to make efficient use of compute resources.<br /> **Setting this is highly recommended.**

    ```yaml
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: '10Gi'
      limits:
        memory: '10Gi'
    ```

  - `namespaceSelector` (`dictionary: {}`) - The selector used by the admission webhook controller to limit what namespaces where injection can happen. If set to null, all non-system namespaces are eligible for injection.

    ```yaml
    # Selectors are defined as a YAML dictionary.
    # In this example, all namespaces with the label "injection: enabled" are eligible:
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        injection: enabled
    ```

  - `objectSelector` (`dictionary: {}`) - The selector used by the admission webhook controller to limit what objects can be effected by mutation.

    ```yaml
    # Selectors are defined as a YAML dictionary.
    # In this example, all namespaces with the label "injection: enabled" are eligible:

      matchLabels:
        injection: enabled
    ```

  - `extraLabels` (`dictionary: {}`) - This value defines additional labels for Vault Agent Injector pods.

    ```yaml
    extraLabels:
      'sample/label1': 'foo'
      'sample/label2': 'bar'
    ```

  - `certs` - The certs section configures how the webhook TLS certs are configured. These are the TLS certs for the Kube apiserver communicating to the webhook. By default, the injector will generate and manage its own certs, but this requires the ability for the injector to update its own `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`. In a production environment, custom certs should probably be used. Configure the values below to enable this.

    - `secretName` (`string: ""`) - secretName is the name of the Kubernetes secret that has the TLS certificate and private key to serve the injector webhook. If this is null, then the injector will default to its automatic management mode.

    - `caBundle` (`string: ""`) - The PEM-encoded CA public certificate bundle for the TLS certificate served by the injector. This must be specified as a string and can't come from a secret because it must be statically configured on the Kubernetes `MutatingAdmissionWebhook` resource. This only needs to be specified if `secretName` is not null.

    - `certName` (`string: "tls.crt"`) - The name of the certificate file within the `secretName` secret.

  - `affinity` - This value defines the [affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity) for Vault Agent Injector pods. It defaults to allowing only a single pod on each node, which minimizes risk of the cluster becoming unusable if a node is lost. If you need to run more pods per node (for example, testing on Minikube), set this value to `null`.

    ```yaml
    # Recommended default server affinity:
    affinity: |
      podAntiAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - labelSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app.kubernetes.io/name: {{ template "vault.name" . }}-agent-injector
              app.kubernetes.io/instance: "{{ .Release.Name }}"
              component: webhook
          topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname

    ```

  - `failurePolicy` (`string: "Ignore"`) - When set to `Fail`, an error calling the webhook causes the admission to fail and the API request to be rejected.
    When set to `Ignore`, an error calling the webhook is ignored and the API request is allowed to continue. Allowed values: `Fail`, `Ignore`.

  - `service` - The service section configures the Kubernetes service for the Vault Agent Injector.

    - `annotations` (`dictionary: {}`) - This value defines additional annotations to
      add to the Vault Agent Injector service. This can either be YAML or a YAML-formatted
      multi-line templated string.

      annotations:
        "sample/annotation1": "foo"
        "sample/annotation2": "bar"
      # or
      annotations: |

    Supported log formats include: `standard`, `json`.

  - `resources` (`dictionary: {}`) - The resource requests and limits (CPU, memory, etc.) for each container of the server. This should be a YAML dictionary of a Kubernetes [ResourceRequirements](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.15/#resourcerequirements-v1-core) object. If this isn't specified, then the pods won't request any specific amount of resources, which limits the ability for Kubernetes to make efficient use of compute resources. **Setting this is highly recommended.**

      ```yaml
      resources:
        requests:

For more information see the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#rolling-updates).

    - `config` (`string: "{}"`) -
      A raw string of extra HCL or JSON [configuration](/docs/configuration) for Vault servers.
      This will be saved as-is into a ConfigMap that is read by the Vault servers.
      This can be used to add additional configuration that isn't directly exposed by the chart.

    ```yaml
    # ExtraConfig values are formatted as a multi-line string:
    config: |
      ui = true
      api_addr = "http://POD_IP:8200"
      listener "tcp" {
          tls_disable = 1
