# Installing the Vault CSI Provider

## Prerequisites

* Kubernetes 1.16+ for both the master and worker nodes (Linux-only)
* [Secrets store CSI driver](https://secrets-store-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/getting-started/installation.html) installed
* `TokenRequest` endpoint available, which requires setting the flags
  `--service-account-signing-key-file` and `--service-account-issuer` for
  `kube-apiserver`. Set by default from 1.20+ and earlier in most managed services.

## Installation using helm

The [Vault Helm chart](/docs/platform/k8s/helm) is the recommended way to
install and configure the Vault CSI Provider in Kubernetes.

To install a new instance of Vault and the Vault CSI Provider, first add the
HashiCorp helm repository and ensure you have access to the chart:

~> Vault CSI Provider Helm installation requires Vault Helm 0.10.0+.

```shell-session
$ helm repo add hashicorp https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com
"hashicorp" has been added to your repositories

$ helm search repo hashicorp/vault
NAME           	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION
hashicorp/vault	0.10.0       	1.7.0      	Official HashiCorp Vault Chart
```

Then install the chart and enable the CSI feature by setting the
`csi.enabled` value to `true`:

```bash
# Note: this will also install the Vault server and Agent Injector.
helm install vault hashicorp/vault --set="csi.enabled=true"
```

Upgrades may be performed with `helm upgrade` on an existing install. Please
always run Helm with `--dry-run` before any install or upgrade to verify
changes.

You can see all the available values settings by running `helm inspect values hashicorp/vault` or by reading the [Vault Helm Configuration
Docs](/docs/platform/k8s/helm/configuration). Commonly used values in the Helm
chart include limiting the namespaces the Vault CSI Provider runs in, TLS options and
more.
