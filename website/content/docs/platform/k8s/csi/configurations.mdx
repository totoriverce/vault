# Command line arguments

The following command line arguments are supported by the Vault CSI provider.
If installing via the helm chart, they can be set using e.g.
`--set "csi.extraArgs={-debug=true}"`.

- `-debug` `(bool: false)` - Set to true to enable debug level logging.

- `-endpoint` `(string: "/tmp/vault.sock")` - Path to unix socket on which the
  provider will listen for gRPC calls from the driver.

- `-health-addr` `(string: ":8080")` - (v0.3.0+) The address of the HTTP listener
  for reporting health.

- `-health_addr` `(string: "")` - Deprecated, please use -health-addr. Slated
  for removal in 0.5.0.

- `-vault-addr` `(string: "https://127.0.0.1:8200")` - (v0.3.0+) Default address
  for connecting to Vault. Can be overridden per Secret Provider Class object.

- `-vault-mount` `(string: "kubernetes")` - (v0.3.0+) Default Vault mount path
  for Kubernetes authentication. Can be overridden per Secret Provider Class
  object.

- `-version` `(bool: false)` - prints the version information

- `-write-secrets` `(bool: true)` - (v0.3.0+) Write secrets directly to
  filesystem (true), or send secrets to CSI driver in gRPC response (false).
  Setting to false requires Secrets Store CSI Driver v0.0.21+. This flag will
  default to false from v0.4.0, and setting it to false will be required when
  using Secrets Store CSI Driver v0.0.24+.
