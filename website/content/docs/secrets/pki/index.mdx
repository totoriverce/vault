# PKI Secrets Engine

@include 'x509-sha1-deprecation.mdx'

-> **Vault as Consul CA provider:** If you are using Vault 1.11.0+ as a Connect CA, run a Consul version which includes the fix for [GH-15525](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/pull/15525). Refer to this [Knowledge Base article](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/articles/11308460105491) for more details.

The PKI secrets engine generates dynamic X.509 certificates. With this secrets
engine, services can get certificates without going through the usual manual
process of generating a private key and CSR, submitting to a CA, and waiting for
a verification and signing process to complete. Vault's built-in authentication
and authorization mechanisms provide the verification functionality.

By keeping TTLs relatively short, revocations are less likely to be needed,
keeping CRLs short and helping the secrets engine scale to large workloads. This
in turn allows each instance of a running application to have a unique
certificate, eliminating sharing and the accompanying pain of revocation and
rollover.

In addition, by allowing revocation to mostly be forgone, this secrets engine
allows for ephemeral certificates. Certificates can be fetched and stored in
memory upon application startup and discarded upon shutdown, without ever being
written to disk.
