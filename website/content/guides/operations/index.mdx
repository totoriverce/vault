# Vault Operations

Vault Operations guides address Vault infrastructure discussions. These
guides are designed to help the operations team to plan and install a Vault
cluster that meets your organization's needs.

- [Vault Reference Architecture](/guides/operations/reference-architecture)
  guide provides guidance in the best practices of _Vault Enterprise_ implementations
  through use of a reference architecture. This example is to convey a general
  architecture, which is likely to be adapted to accommodate the specific needs of
  each implementation.

- [Vault Deployment Guide](/guides/operations/deployment-guide) covers the
  steps required to install and configure a single HashiCorp Vault cluster as
  defined in the Vault Reference Architecture.

- [Vault HA with Consul](/guides/operations/vault-ha-consul) guide
  walks you through a simple Vault HA cluster implementation which is backed by
  [HashiCorp Consul](https://www.consul.io/intro/index).

- [Production Hardening](/guides/operations/production) guide provides
  guidance on best practices for a production hardened deployment of Vault.
  The recommendations are based on the [security model](/docs/internals/security)
  and focus on defense in depth.

- [Root Token Generation](/guides/operations/generate-root) guide
  demonstrates the workflow of regenerating root tokens. It is considered to be a
  best practice not to persist the initial **root** token. If a root token needs
  to be regenerated, this guide helps you walk through the task.

- [Rekeying & Rotating](/guides/operations/rekeying-and-rotating) guide
  provides a high-level overview of Shamir's Secret Sharing Algorithm, and how to
  perform _rekey_ and _rotate_ operations in Vault.

- [Building Plugin Backends](/guides/operations/plugin-backends) guide
  provides steps to build, register, and mount non-database external plugin
  backends.

## Vault Enterprise

- [Replication Setup & Guidance](/guides/operations/replication)
  walks you through the commands to activate the Vault servers in replication mode.
  Please note that [Vault Replication](/docs/enterprise/replication)
  is a Vault Enterprise feature.

- [Disaster Recovery Replication Setup](/guides/operations/disaster-recovery)
  guide provides step-by-step instruction of setting up a disaster recovery (DR)
  cluster.

- [Mount Filter](/guides/operations/mount-filter)
  guide demonstrates how to selectively filter out secret engines from being
  replicated across clusters. This feature can help organizations to comply with
  **_General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)_**.

- [Performance Standby Nodes](/guides/operations/performance-nodes) guide
  describes how Vault HA works with performance standby nodes.

- [Multi-Tenant Pattern with Namespaces](/guides/operations/multi-tenant)
  guide discuss a pattern to isolate secrets using ACL Namespaces.

- [Vault Auto-unseal using AWS Key Management Service (KMS)](/guides/operations/autounseal-aws-kms) guide demonstrates an example of
  how to use Terraform to provision an instance that utilizes an encryption key
  from AWS Key Management Service (KMS).

- [Seal Wrap / FIPS 140-2](/guides/operations/seal-wrap)
  guide demonstrates how Vault's seal wrap feature works to encrypt your secrets
  leveraging FIPS 140-2 certified HSM.

- [Vault Cluster Monitoring Guide](/guides/operations/monitoring) walks
  you through Vault cluster monitoring with telemetry collected by
  [Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/) and
  forwarded to
  [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/) and
  [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for analysis.
